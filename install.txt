Installation
=============================

1. Install node.js
---------------------------
- Install the node.js into your system if not present. Download it from:  https://nodejs.org/en/
- Afrer installation, open a command line and type:
	node --version
  This will give you the node's version and will confirm the successful installation.
  
2. Install http-seerver
---------------------------
- Open a command line and type:
	npm install -g http-server
	
3. Run the demo
---------------------------
- Open a command line and move to the sample's root folder.
- Type:  
	http-server
  This will present on the screen something like:
	Starting up http-server, serving ./
	Available on:
	  http://127.0.0.1:8080   
- At this point a sample http server proxies the static files of the demo, and you can visit the demo at:
	localhost:8080
  If you can't see the application make sure that you ran http server from inside the ROOT folder where static files are located.


NOTE: the sample data file is located inside /data folder. You can use this file or another one but make sure that the name is the same and that the new file complies with the expected format.
